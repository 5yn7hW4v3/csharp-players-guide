# Challenge | The Variable Shop | 100 XP

You see an old shopkeeper struggling to stack up variables in a window display. “Hoo-wee! All these
variable types sure are exciting but setting them all up to show them off to excited new programmers
like yourself is a lot of work for these aching bones,” she says. “You wouldn’t mind helping me set up this
program with one variable of every type, would you?”

*Objectives:*

- Build a program with a variable of all fourteen types described in this level.
- Assign each of them a value using a literal of the correct type.
- Use Console.WriteLine to display the contents of each variable.
